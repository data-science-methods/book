# Joins #

*Joins* are an extremely powerful tool for data science, allowing us to combine two datasets by matching columns.  

Some common scenarios: 

- Data from two different sources for the same units
    - Pre- and post-treatment
    - Multi-round experiments / survey panels
    - Advertising and vote share

- Data on different levels
    - Students in classrooms in schools
    - Census block groups in counties in states


## Types of joins ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', out.width = '45%', fig.cap = 'Join operations combine two dataframes based on one or more matching columns.  Different join operations keep different rows from the combination.  Sources: <https://data-lessons.github.io/gapminder-R/>; <https://notchained.hatenablog.com/entry/2015/01/03/160700>'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'join-rows.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'join-venn.png'))
```

- Suppose we have two dataframes, `left` and `right`
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

left = tribble(
    ~animal, ~zoo,
    'aardvark', 'Sacramento', 
    'aardvark', 'San Diego',
    'chimpanzee', 'San Diego',
    'zebra', 'San Diego'
)
right = tribble(
    ~animal, ~food, 
    'aardvark', 'insects', 
    'chimpanzee', 'insects', 
    'chimpanzee', 'fruit', 
    'velociraptor', 'animals'
)
```


- *Left join*: keep all of the rows and columns from `left`; add columns from `right`
```{r}
left_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Right join*: keep all of the rows and columns from `right`; add columns from `left`
```{r}
right_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Full join*: keep all rows and columns from both `left` and `right`
```{r}
full_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Inner join*: keep all columns, but only rows that match
```{r}
inner_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Anti-join*: keep all columns from `left`, but only the rows that *don't* match
```{r}
anti_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```


## Hazards ##

Joins can create a number of hazards. 

- *Missing values* from left, right, and full joins
    - In a left join, rows from `left` that don't match will have missing values in the columns from `right`
- *Row counts* can be difficult to predict in advance
    - Rows will be copied if they match multiple times
- *Column names* can be changed if they're repeated across dataframes but not used for matching


To manage these hazards

- Use `anti_join()` to figure out where missing values will be
- Use `select()` with `distinct()` to check for unexpected duplications
- Use `names()` to check column names
    
### Data ###

To examine these hazards, we'll use the `nycflights13` dataset, which includes all flights that departed New York City in 2013. 

The dataset comprises 5 different tables, which of which can be linked to the others using joins.  We'll focus on combining `flights` with `airports` and `weather`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Linking fields in the tables of the `nycflights13` dataset.'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'relational-nycflights.png'))
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(visdat)

flights
airports
weather
```

Some quick data quality observations:

```{r}
## `flights` has 8.3k missing values for departure and arrival times
tail(flights)
flights %>% 
    filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
    nrow()

## Draw a sample of 1k rows and pipe them into vis_miss()
set.seed(2020-09-20)
flights %>% 
    sample_n(1000) %>% 
    vis_miss(cluster = TRUE)

## But origin is complete
flights %>% 
    filter(is.na(origin)) %>% 
    nrow()

## And has 3 different values, for the 3 airports in New York City
count(flights, origin)
```

### A good join ###

*Expectation*:  For every flight, we can match the origin code to `airports`. 

```{r}
goodjoin = left_join(flights, airports, by = c('origin' = 'faa'))

nrow(flights)
nrow(goodjoin)

## If we couldn't match an origin code, `tzone` would be NA
goodjoin %>% 
    filter(is.na(tzone))
```

### Bad join #1 ###

*Expectation*: Every airport has at least 1 originating flight. 

```{r}
problems = right_join(flights, airports, by = c('origin' = 'faa'))

## Row counts
nrow(flights)
nrow(problems)

## Missing values
tail(problems)
problems %>% 
    filter(is.na(carrier)) %>% 
    nrow()
problems %>% 
    filter(is.na(carrier)) %>% 
    select(year, month, day, carrier, origin, name, tzone)
```

Manage this using `anti_join()` to determine which airports aren't in `origin`. 

```{r}
anti_join(airports, flights, by = c('faa' = 'origin'))
```


### Bad join #2 ###

Calculate the average daily temperature at each airport. 

```{r}
avg_temp = weather %>% 
    group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>% 
    summarize(temp = mean(temp)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

*Expectation*: Each flight has 1 average daily temperature at its origin. 

```{r}
mult_problems = inner_join(flights, avg_temp, 
                           by = c('year', 'month', 'day'))
nrow(flights)
nrow(mult_problems)
## `mult_problems` has almost 3x more rows than `flights`
nrow(mult_problems) / nrow(flights)
```

One way to figure out what happened is to check the names of the columns.  The `dplyr` join functions add `.x` and `.y` when they encounter repeated column names.  

```{r}
mult_problems %>% 
    select(matches('.x'))

count(mult_problems, origin.x, origin.y)
```
