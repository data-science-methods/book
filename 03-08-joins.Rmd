# Joins #

```{r child = 'knitr_config.Rmd'}
```

*Joins* are an extremely powerful tool for data science, allowing us to combine two datasets by matching columns.  

---

Some common scenarios: 

- Data from two different sources for the same units
    - Pre- and post-treatment
    - Multi-round experiments / survey panels
    - Advertising and vote share

- Data on different levels
    - Students in classrooms in schools
    - Census block groups in counties in states


## Types of joins ##

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', out.width = '45%', fig.cap = 'Join operations combine two dataframes based on one or more matching columns.  Different join operations keep different rows from the combination.  Sources: <https://data-lessons.github.io/gapminder-R/>; <https://notchained.hatenablog.com/entry/2015/01/03/160700>'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'join-rows.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'join-venn.png'))
```

- Suppose we have two dataframes, `left` and `right`
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

left = tribble(
    ~animal, ~zoo,
    'aardvark', 'Sacramento', 
    'aardvark', 'San Diego',
    'chimpanzee', 'San Diego',
    'zebra', 'San Diego'
)
right = tribble(
    ~animal, ~food, 
    'aardvark', 'insects', 
    'chimpanzee', 'insects', 
    'chimpanzee', 'fruit', 
    'velociraptor', 'animals'
)
```


- *Left join*: keep all of the rows and columns from `left`; add columns from `right`
```{r}
left_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Right join*: keep all of the rows and columns from `right`; add columns from `left`
```{r}
right_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Full join*: keep all rows and columns from both `left` and `right`
```{r}
full_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Inner join*: keep all columns, but only rows that match
```{r}
inner_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```

- *Anti-join*: keep all columns from `left`, but only the rows that *don't* match
```{r}
anti_join(left, right, by = 'animal')
```


## Hazards ##

Joins can create a number of hazards. 

- *Missing values* from left, right, and full joins
    - In a left join, rows from `left` that don't match will have missing values in the columns from `right`
- *Row counts* can be difficult to predict in advance
    - Rows will be copied if they match multiple times
- *Column names* can be changed if they're repeated across dataframes but not used for matching


## To manage these hazards ##

- Use `anti_join()` to figure out where missing values will be
- Use `select()` with `distinct()` to check for unexpected duplications
- Use `names()` to check column names
