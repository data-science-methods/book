# The Grammar of Graphics #

```{r child = 'knitr_config.Rmd'}
```

- Reading: @WilkinsonGrammarGraphics1999; @WickhamLayeredGrammarGraphics2010

- A lot of programming sublanguages for creating graphics are based on the *artist's palette* model
    - Define some low-level tools for drawing on a canvas: `points()`, `lines()`, `curve()`
    - One-liners that bundle these tools into standard plots: `hist()`, `barplot()`
    - This is used by base graphics in R, Python packages including `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, MATLAB, etc.

- *Grammar of graphics* is a fundamentally different approach
    - Implemented by `ggplot2` in the tidyverse
    - (Strictly speaking, `ggplot` is another package that Hadley Wickham created before `ggplot2`. But almost no one uses the older package.  If people talk about "ggplot," they almost always mean `ggplot2`.)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The Grammar of Graphics regards graphs as mappings from variables in the data to features of geometric objects. This means that every graph is a model.', out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'grammar_of_graphics.png'))
```

- *Graphs are maps*
    - A graph maps variables in the data to features of geometric objects
    - An individual map is called an *aesthetic*
    - So a graph is a collection of aesthetics applied to a dataset

- **Graphs are models**
    - Simplifications of the data
    - Designed to fit with our cognitive capabilities
    - In ways that support pattern detection, inference
    - Recall Leonelli's relational view of data
    - (Cog sci folks: would you use the term "cognitive affordance" here?)
