- The reproducibility side of the replication crisis suggests that academic science has a reproducibility problem
- But software engineering doesn't


## What can we learn from software engineering? ##

- Things we've already talked about
    - develop in a clean workspace
        - restart and rerun often
    - version control

- Things we'll talk about in this section of the course
    - using a style guide and linter
    - the life-changing magic of tidying up (your files)
    - code review
    - documenting code and data

- Things we'll talk about later, time permitting
    - `make` and continuous integration for automating reproducibility
    - unit testing for validating code


## Code style ##

- In written language, conventions for punctuation, capitalization aid comprehension by indicating structure

- Style guides do the same thing for code
    - In-line spacing makes it easier to pick out distinguish functions, operators, and variables in a line
    - Returns distinguish arguments in a function call
    - Indentation corresponds to structure of complex expressions
    - Common conventions for naming, assignment reduce cognitive load
