# Organizing your projects #

- Reading: @NobleQuickGuideOrganizing2009

- Good project organization will
    - Keep your project self-contained, making it easy to find files as needed
    - Play nicely with version control
    - Self-document key relationships between project files

## Two templates ##

### @NobleQuickGuideOrganizing2009 ###

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Noble's [-@NobleQuickGuideOrganizing2009] sample folder structure is designed for experimental biologists."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', 'reproducibility', 'noble.png'))
```

- Includes code for 
    - running experiments
    - cleaning and analyzing data
    - typesetting a LateX file into a PDF

- Other features 
    - notebook file, updated regularly
    - chronological folders for experimental runs
    - folders for compiled code and their corresponding source files

### DJH's Project Template ###

- <https://github.com/dhicks/project_template>

- Configured as a GitHub "template," making it easy to create new repositories for new projects

- Designated folders for data, plots/outputs, and utility functions

- File naming convention
    - Automatically orders analysis scripts
    - Coordinates plots, outputs, and intermediate data with the script that creates them
    
- R package infrastructure
    - Enables one-liner to load the utility functions in `R`: `devtools::load_all('..')`
