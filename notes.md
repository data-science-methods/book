# Notes for changes for next year #

- require basic familiarity with R; offer workshop or pre-semester session on R basics
- explicit expectation that lab discussion questions are answered on Slack
- git probably needs notes on resolving conflicts, if only for getting students unstuck
- do cover getting help w/ R in class

- open wtf data science by asking students for their preconceptions about data science

- make Ames housing data 2-part lab: 1. part inspecting variables, 2. part visual

- more callbacks to previous material

- walk through testing infrastructure and how to read feedback

- moral aspects of open science/open data
    - move data management horror stories to data management notes

- BezuidenhoutWhatDoesIt2020

- reproducibility identified as most difficult (too quick; difficult w/ limited experience w/ R; lots of moving parts)

- want more EDA, better integration of final project, more paired coding

- liked the labs

- want more live coding, less seminar
