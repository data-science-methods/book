## The Role of Visuals in EDA ##

- @TukeyExploratoryDataAnalysis1977 emphasized visual methods for EDA
- Including not just graphs but also structured tables, such as [stem-and-leaf displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-and-leaf_display)


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'A stem-and-leaf display, promoted by Tukey for use in EDA', out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Stem_leaf_plot_001.png')
```

- In terms of our models of EDA (ch. \@ref(eda-models))
    - Epicycle of analysis:  
        - Check expectations about the distribution of variables
            - Outliers 
            - Degeneracies (eg, perfect correlation)
            - Skew or bimodal distributions
            - Non-linear relationships
        - Develop expectations about relationships between variables

    - Phenomena development: 
        - Quickly identify potential patterns
        - Contrast potential patterns with noise/uncertainty/imprecision


## Plot Your Data ##

- Summary statistics almost always focus only on central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, IQR)
    - This is all you would need if the world were made of normal distributions
    - The world is not made of normal distributions [@LyonWhyAreNormal2014]

- We'll illustrate this using The Datasaurus Dozen [@MatejkaSameStatsDifferent]

---

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)
library(ggforce)

## We'll need this, but don't want to load it
## install.packages('Hmisc')

theme_set(theme_minimal())

ds_df = datasaurus_dozen
```

---

- The dataset combines 13 different datasets with $n=142$ for each

```{r}
ds_df
count(ds_df, dataset)
```

---

- The datasets have the same means, standard deviations, and (Pearson) correlation coefficient
    - p-value of the correlation coefficient is not statistically significant

```{r}
## This is a more complex summarize() call than we've seen before
## 1. Number of rows
## 2. "Summarize across the columns x and y, using the functions mean and sd"; automatically generates names
## 3. Correlation between x and y
## 4. p-value from a t-test of the null that the correlation = 0
ds_df %>% 
    group_by(dataset) %>% 
    summarize(n = n(), 
              across(.cols = c(x, y), 
                     .fns = lst(mean, sd)), 
              cor_xy = cor(x, y), 
              p_value = cor.test(x, y)$p.value) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

---

- But, when plotted, they're obviously very different 

```{r}
ggplot(ds_df, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(vars(dataset))
```


## Bar plots, and better than bar plots ##

- @WeissgerberBarLineGraphs2015 argue for the importance of plotting data, not just summaries, even in publications

- Let's pull a few datasets out of datasaurus, as though they were two groups in a study

```{r}
cdw_df = ds_df |> 
    filter(dataset %in% c('circle', 'dino', 'wide_lines'))
```

## A bar plot of mean + 95% CI

```{r}
ggplot(cdw_df, aes(x = dataset, 
                   y = x)) +
    stat_summary(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.2,
                 fun.data = mean_cl_boot) +
    stat_summary(geom = 'bar', fun = mean, 
                 aes(fill = dataset)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(guide = 'none')
```

## Replace the bar with the data

```{r}
ggplot(cdw_df, aes(x = dataset, 
                   y = x)) +
    # geom_point(aes(color = dataset)) +
    geom_sina(aes(color = dataset)) +
    stat_summary(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.2,
                 fun.data = mean_cl_boot) +
    scale_color_viridis_d(guide = 'none')
```

## Even fancier: Violin plot ##

```{r}
ggplot(cdw_df, aes(x = dataset, y = x, fill = dataset)) +
    geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(.5)) +
    geom_sina() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(guide = 'none')
```
