## Standard definition ##

(ref:ds-standard) Data science, defined as the intersection of CS, stats, and "business knowledge." Source: <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/top-10-lists-data-science.html>

- The intersection of computer science/software engineering, statistics, and "business knowledge"

Or, more concretely, 

(ref:boykis) Boykis Twitter poll of "data scientists"; 67% said they spend most of their time cleaning data/moving data. Source: <https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1089920316644704256>

While it is boring grunt work I think there is so much to be learned in putting together a dataset. It is like half the problem." Source: <https://twitter.com/kscottz/status/1091423467772162049>

However,

- This focuses on *tools and techniques*, not the epistemic and practical *goals* of data science
    - An ecologist spends most of their time collecting specimens in the field and processing them in a lab, vs. 
    - An ecologist studies interactions among organisms and their environment

## A prior question: What is this thing called "data"? ##

- *Representational view*: Data are "reliable representations of reality which are produced via the interaction between humans and the world"
    - "The production of data is equivalent to 'capturing' features of the world that can be used for systematic study"
    - "Data [are seen as] as 'raw' products of research, which are as close as it gets to unmediated knowledge of reality"
    - Data provide "an objective foundation for the acquisition of knowledge" [@LeonelliScientificResearchBig2020]
    - **Data become data when they're produced according to a reliable, standardized measurement process**

- *Relational view*: "Data are objects that are treated as potential or actual evidence for scientific claims in ways that can, at least in principle, be scrutinised and accounted for"
    - "Any object can be used as a datum, or stop being used as such, depending on the circumstances"
    - **Data become data when they're used as evidence** [@LeonelliScientificResearchBig2020]
    - Note implications for ideas of "unmediated knowledge" and "objective foundation"
        
## Back to "data science" ##    

- Data science â‰  lab science (often)
    - Data collection isn't standardized
        - Found (or bought), not made
        - Data as byproduct
        - This is the point of the tweets above
        - ex: scraping from Twitter, Wikipedia, administrative records
    - Remixing and recombining data
        - ex: pesticide use + Census data in @HicksCensusDemographicsChlorpyrifos2020
    - Data first, questions later
    - **Relational view is often a better fit**

- The goal of data science is to **produce data**
    - To create, transform, and juxtapose objects such that they can be used as evidence
    - Can be done experimentally in a lab, but in other ways too
