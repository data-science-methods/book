# What is this thing called data science? #

## Standard definition ##

- ![Data science, defined as the intersection of CS, stats, and "business knowledge"](images/Abisiga.jpg){ width=30% }
- Source: <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/top-10-lists-data-science.html>
- The intersection of computer science/software engineering, statistics, and "business knowledge"
- But this focuses on *tools and techniques*, not the epistemic and practical *goals* of data science

## Wait, what's "data"? ##

- *Representational view*: data are "reliable representations of reality which are produced via the interaction between humans and the world"
    - "the production of data is equivalent to 'capturing' features of the world that can be used for systematic study"
    - "data as 'raw' products of research, which are as close as it gets to unmediated knowledge of reality"
    - data provide "an objective foundation for the acquisition of knowledge" [@LeonelliScientificResearchBig2020]
    - **data become data when they're produced according to a standardized measurement process**

- *Relational view*: "data are objects that are treated as potential or actual evidence for scientific claims in ways that can, at least in principle, be scrutinised and accounted for"
    - "any object can be used as a datum, or stop being used as such, depending on the circumstances"
    - **data become data when they're used as evidence** [@LeonelliScientificResearchBig2020]
    - Note implications for ideas of "unmediated knowledge" and "objective foundation"
        
## Back to "data science" ##    

- Data science â‰  lab science (often)
    - data collection isn't standardized
        - found (or bought), not made
        - data as byproduct
        - ex: scraping from Twitter, Wikipedia, administrative records
    - remixing and recombining data
        - ex: pesticide use + Census data in @HicksCensusDemographicsChlorpyrifos2020
    - data first, questions later
    - **relational view is often a better fit**

- The goal of data science is to **produce data**
    - ie, to create and transform objects such that they can be used as evidence
    - Can be done experimentally in a lab, but in other ways too
