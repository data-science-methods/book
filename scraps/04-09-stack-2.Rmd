# A Tech Stack for Automatically Reproduced Research, II #

```{r child = 'knitr_config.Rmd'}
```

## Preliminaries ##

- You'll need to **fork** and clone the [example project](https://GitHub.com/data-science-methods/repro_ex) for this chapter. 
- Create an account on <https://travis-ci.org/> using your GitHub login. 


## Build automation using Make ##

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    - A tool for [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation)
    - [Windows users need to install Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    
- `Makefile` syntax
    - If the depenencies have a later timestamp than the target, run the command
    - If the target doesn't exist, run the command
    - **Tab, not spaces**
        - Because Make is from 1976

```{makefile}
target: [dependency] [dependency] [...]
    [command]
```

A snippet of the example project's `Makefile`:

```{makefile}
## Paper ----
paper: $(PAPER)/paper.pdf
$(PAPER)/paper.pdf: $(PAPER)/paper.md \
                    $(PAPER)/refs.json \
                    $(LASTOUT)
  cd $(PAPER); pandoc paper.md -o paper.pdf --citeproc
```

- Make commands
    - `make` = `make` for the first target
        - By convention, first target should be `all`
    - `make pipe`
        - `touch` and then `make pipe` again
    - `make clean`

- MOAR SYNTAX
    - Variable declarations and references
    - `.PHONY`
    - Functions

## Continuous integration with Travis-CI ##

- What and why is CI
    - Integration: Combining code written by several different (teams of) software engineers
    - Problem: "Works on my machine" $\to$ integration was a massive, slow process
    - Solution: Frequent, automated integration checks

(ref:hudson) Diagram illustrating a continuous integration (CI) workflow. Multiple different (teams of) developers push their work up to a version control system. The CI system automatically retrieves the new version, attempts to build it, runs any defined tests, and reports results. Source:  <http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/tools.php?hudson>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:hudson)"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', 'reproducibility', 'ci.jpg'))
```
- Travis setup
    - [Travis site](https://travis-ci.org/)
    - Create an account using your GitHub login
- File prerequisites
    - `DESCRIPTION`
        - [R Packages: Package Metadata](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html)
        - Travis's R support is built for packages, and won't work without a `DESCRIPTION` file
        - Minimally, list the packages your scripts need under `Imports:`
        - Exactly the same as the labs (because the labs use Travis)
    - `.travis.yaml`
        - Configuration file used by Travis
        - [Building an R project](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r)
        - [Building a Python project](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python)
        - [Docs for other languages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/), doesn't seem to include NetLogo
    - Later we'll need `_deploy.sh`
        - But leave it commented out in `.travis.yaml` for the moment
 
```{yaml}
language: r
cache: packages
pandoc_version: 2.11

# before_script:
#   - chmod +x ./_deploy.sh

script:
  - make pipe
  # - ./_deploy.sh
```


## Hosting using GitHub Pages ##

- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages) is a simple hosting service for static sites built into GitHub
    - Every account gets its own subdomain, `username.github.io`
    - Every repository gets its own folder within the subdomain, `username.github.io/reponame`
    - Need `index.html`

- GitHub setup
    - Create a `gh-pages` branch
    - [Enable gh-pages](https://guides.GitHub.com/features/pages/)
        - GitHub repo page $\to$ Settings $\to$ GitHub Pages
    - [GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
        - Account Settings $\to$ Developer Settings $\to$ Personal access tokens
- Travis setup
    - Generate a PAT *for this particular project*
    - Paste PAT in the Travis settings for this project
- `_deploy.sh`
    - Uncomment lines in `.travis.yml`
    - Change git `user.email` and `user.name`; `OUTPUTFILE.html`
    - Based on [this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html)

```{sh, eval = FALSE}
#!/bin/sh

set -e

[ -z "${GITHUB_PAT}" ] && exit 0
[ "${TRAVIS_BRANCH}" != "master" ] && exit 0

git config --global user.email "your@email.here"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git clone -b gh-pages https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/${TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG}.git temp
cd temp
mv -f ../scripts/OUTPUTFILE.html index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update the reproduced analysis" || true
git push origin gh-pages
```

- After Travis has finished, the reproduced analysis should be viewable at `https://username.github.io/reponame`.
