## Discussion question ##

*Why did you decide to take a class called "data science"?*  

## Standard definition ##

![Data science, defined as the intersection of CS, stats, and "business knowledge." Source: <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/top-10-lists-data-science.html>](images/Abisiga.jpg)

- The intersection of computer science/software engineering, statistics, and "business knowledge"

- But this defines data science in terms of *tools and techniques*, not epistemic and practical *goals*.  Compare: 
    - An ecologist is someone who spends most of their time collecting specimens in the field and processing them in a lab, vs. 
    - An ecologist is someone who studies interactions among organisms and their environment
    
## Discussion questions ## 

- *What are the epistemic and practical goals of your scientific field?* 

- *How do you think "data science" will be useful for pursuing those goals?*
