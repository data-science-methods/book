[@BatesDataJourneysCapturing2016; @MadrigalWhyPandemicExperts2021] Some relevant questions to answer might include\n\n- Who generated these data? Why? How?\n- What measurement instruments were used to generate these data? What infrastructure has  been used to store and transmit the data?\n- What was the original intended use of these data? What are some other ways the data have been used?\n- How has the mutability/immutability of the data been important to its journey & use? How has its mutability/immutability been created and maintained?\n- How will you need to transform the data further for your project? How do the physical and material properties of the data facilitate this, and/or create friction?\n- What values have been crystallized in the data? How have power relations and values shaped what is/isnâ€™t included in the data?\n- Based on these factors, do the data appear to be fit for purpose? That is, based on what you know so far, do the data appear to be appropriate for answering your research question?\n\nInclude references for the sources you use to answer these questions. You can work on this step of the project at the same time as the EDA step, but I will ask you to turn in the data journey narrative first. A good target length for your narrative is 500-1,000 words long, not counting any references.\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis {#eda-models}\n\n## <br>\n\n> This book is about exploratory data analysis, about looking at data to see what it seems to say. It concentrates on simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw pictures. It regards whatever appearances we have recognized as partial descriptions, and tries to look beneath them for new insights. Its concern is with appearance, not with confirmation. [@TukeyExploratoryDataAnalysis1977]\n\n> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is \"an attitude, AND a flexibility, AND some graph paper (or transparencies, or both)\" [@TukeyWeNeedBoth1980]\n\n\n## Exploratory and Confirmatory Research ##\n\nEspecially in the wake of the replication crisis, one common distinction is between exploratory and confirmatory research [@WagenmakersAgendaPurelyConfirmatory2012]\n\n![@WagenmakersAgendaPurelyConfirmatory2012 figure 1. The caption reads, in part: \"A continuum of experimental exploration and the corresponding continuum of statistical wonkiness. On the far left of the continuum, researchers find their hypothesis in the data by post-hoc theorizing, and the corresponding statistics are 'wonky,' dramatically overestimating the evidence for the hypothesis.\"](https://journals.sagepub.com/cms/10.1177/1745691612463078/asset/images/large/10.1177_1745691612463078-fig1.jpeg)\n\n----\n\nTable: Exploratory vs. confirmatory research\n\n------------------------------------\nConfirmatory                    Exploratory\n---------------------           -------------------------------\nhypothesis testing              hypothesis development\n\nspecified in advance            adaptable\n\nalgorithmic                     free, creative\n\nmechanical objectivity\\          pure subjectivity? \n[@DastonObjectivity2007]\n\navoids inferential errors       *makes* errors?\n\n**rigorous**                    **lacking rigor?**\n\n**real science??**              **h\\*cking around with data??**\n\n**assumes experimental          **relevant to all methods**\nmethods**\n------------------------------------\n\n----\n\nI agree that it's important to\n\n- be thoughtful about how much confidence we're placing in our conclusions\n- interpret findings from one study in light of other studies\n\n\\\nBut the confirmatory/exploratory distinction can overhype the confirmatory side\n    \n- Making us too rigid and narrow-minded about what counts as good science\n\n\n## Better Models for EDA I: Developing Phenomena ##\n\n@BogenSavingPhenomena1988 by way of @BrownSmokeMirrorsHow2002\n\nTable: The data/phenomena/theory distinction\n\n-------------------------------------\n                                               Theories/\nData                    Phenomena              Causal processes\n---------------------   ---------------------  ---------------------\nEx: Spreadsheet of      Ex: Correlation        Ex:  Conservative\nnumbers, downloaded     between                susceptibility to \nfrom Qualtrics          partisanship and       anxiety hypothesis\n                        sharing Covid \n                        misinformation\n                        \n\\                                                                                       \n\ncollected               abstracted or          postulated\n                        extracted from data\n\nnot explained           explained by theories  explain phenomena\n\nhighly local to         varying scope          universal?\ntime, place, sample,\nprocedure\n\n\"raw,\" messy,           \"processed,\" clean,    \"laws of nature\"? \nunwieldy                stylized\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n## EDA as phenomena development ##\n\n- cleaning messy data \n    - identifying and mitigating (where possible) errors and idiosyncracies\n- identifying *local* patterns (\"local phenomena\")\n\n\\\n\n- **not yet claiming these will be stable and appear elsewhere**\n- **not yet worrying (much) about explanations**\n\n\n## Better Models for EDA II: Epicycle of Analysis ##\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Epicycle of analysis model, @PengArtDataScience2016, 5](images/03-eda/epicycle.png){width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## @PengArtDataScience2016\n\n- Data analysis is organized into 5 activities\n- Each activity involves the same 3-step \"epicycle\" process\n    1.
