Formulate your question ##\n\n- The Black Lives Matter protests over the last several years have made us aware of the racial aspects of policing.  \n\n- Here we're specifically interested in\n    1. Whether Black people in Oakland might be more likely to be stopped than White people\n    2. Whether Black people who are stopped might be more likely to have contraband\n\n- These aren't very precise, but that's okay: \n    Part of the goal of EDA is to clarify and refine our research questions\n\n\n\n## Reflexivity {.smaller}\n\n1. Whether Black people in Oakland might be more likely to be stopped than White people\n2. Whether Black people who are stopped might be more likely to have contraband\n\n- Once we have a rough idea of *what* we want to know, we need to take a moment to think about *why* we want to know it\n    - Clarify what \"success\" means to us\n    - Share with others to whom we're accountable\n    - Recognize that we (academic researchers) often lack accountability to people who might be affected by our work\n    - **especially when we claim to be acting for their benefit**\n\n- We'll spend 3 minutes writing responses to each of these questions: \n\n1. What do I already know about this subject? \n2. Why am I studying this? \n3. What do I expect or hope to find/learn, and why? \n4. Who is affected by this topic, and how am I connected to them? \n\n(Adapted from @TanweerWhyDataRevolution2021, 14-15, and @LiboironPollutionColonialism2021)\n\n\n## Set up our workspace ##\n\n- Dedicated project folder\n- Clean R session\n- More on project management and organization later in the semester\n\n\n## Packages ##\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # for working with the data\nlibrary(lubridate)   # for working with datetime data\n\nlibrary(skimr)       # generate a text-based overview of the data\nlibrary(visdat)      # generate plots visualizing data types and missingness\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Get the Data ##\n\n- We'll be using data on police stops in Oakland, California, collected and published by the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/).  \n\n- For reproducibility, we'll write a bit of code that automatically downloads the data\n\n- To get the download URL: \n    1. <https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/>\n    2.

This shows us an Excel-like spreadsheet presentation of a dataframe.  \n\n`View()` can cause significant problems if you use it with a large dataframe on a slower machine.

Do these ranges make sense for what we expect the variable to be?  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nskim(dataf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n── Data Summary ────────────────────────\n                           Values\nName                       dataf \nNumber of rows             133407\nNumber of columns          28    \n_______________________          \nColumn type frequency:           \n  character                16    \n  Date                     1     \n  difftime                 1     \n  logical                  7     \n  numeric                  3     \n________________________         \nGroup variables            None  \n\n── Variable type: character ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   skim_variable                 n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace\n 1 raw_row_number                        0        1        1  71     0   133407          0\n 2 location                             51        1.00     1  78     0    60723          0\n 3 beat                              72424        0.457    3  19     0      129          0\n 4 subject_race                          0        1        5  22     0        5          0\n 5 subject_sex                          90        0.999    4   6     0        2          0\n 6 officer_assignment               121431        0.0898   5  97     0       20          0\n 7 type                              20066        0.850    9  10     0        2          0\n 8 outcome                           34107        0.744    6   8     0        3          0\n 9 search_basis                      92250        0.309    5  14     0        3          0\n10 reason_for_stop                       0        1       14 197     0      113          0\n11 use_of_force_description         116734        0.125   10  10     0        1          0\n12 raw_subject_sdrace                    0        1        1   1     0        7          0\n13 raw_subject_resultofencounter         0        1        7 213     0      315          0\n14 raw_subject_searchconducted           0        1        2  24     0       34          0\n15 raw_subject_typeofsearch          52186        0.609    2 112     0      417          0\n16 raw_subject_resultofsearch       111633        0.163    5  95     0      298          0\n\n── Variable type: Date ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min        max        median     n_unique\n1 date                  2          1.00 2013-04-01 2017-12-31 2015-07-19     1638\n\n── Variable type: difftime ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min    max        median n_unique\n1 time                  2          1.00 0 secs 86340 secs 16:12      1439\n\n── Variable type: logical ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  skim_variable      n_missing complete_rate   mean count                  \n1 arrest_made                0         1     0.121  FAL: 117217, TRU: 16190\n2 citation_issued            0         1     0.394  FAL: 80836, TRU: 52571 \n3 warning_issued             0         1     0.231  FAL: 102545, TRU: 30862\n4 contraband_found       92250         0.309 0.149  FAL: 35005, TRU: 6152  \n5 contraband_drugs       92250         0.309 0.0844 FAL: 37684, TRU: 3473  \n6 contraband_weapons     92250         0.309 0.0299 FAL: 39928, TRU: 1229  \n7 search_conducted           0         1     0.309  FAL: 92250, TRU: 41157 \n\n── Variable type: numeric ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate   mean      sd     p0    p25    p50    p75   p100 hist \n1 lat                 114         0.999   37.8  0.0284   37.4   37.8   37.8   37.8   38.1 ▁▁▇▁▁\n2 lng                 114         0.999 -122.   0.0432 -122.  -122.  -122.  -122.  -119.  ▇▁▁▁▁\n3 subject_age      102724         0.230   33.2 13.3      10     23     29     41     97   ▇▆▃▁▁\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Date range is April 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017\n    - If we break things down by year, we should expect 2013 to have fewer cases\n    - For some purposes, we might need to exclude 2013 data:  `filter(dataf, date >= '2014-01-01')`\n- Age range is from 10 years old (!) to 97 (!)\n    - Median (`p50`) is 29; 50% of values are between 23 and 41\n    - For some purposes, we might need to restrict the analysis to working-age adults: `filter(dataf, subject_age >= 18, subject_age < 65)`\n    \n## 5.

Follow up ##\n\n- There are several directions we could take this analysis:  \n    - Investigate outstanding questions about quality and reliability of the data\n        - eg, follow up with Stanford Open Policing Project about the difference in row counts\n        - Fits with *epicycle of analysis*: checking expectations\n\n    - Break down our question into more fine-grained analyses\n        - eg, the Oakland web site and report talk about policy changes; do we see changes by year in the data? \n        - Fits with *epicycle of analysis*: refine and specify research questions\n\n    - Apply more sophisticated statistical analysis\n        - eg, a regression model to control for age, gender, and other covariates\n        - Fits with *phenomena development*: reducing data, eliminating noise, in order to identity local phenomena\n\n\n## Discussion questions ##\n\n1. Suppose you've conducted this EDA because you're working with an activist organization that promotes defunding the police and prison abolition.  Should you share the preliminary findings above with your organization contacts?  \n\n2. What influence should the following factors make to your answer?  \n    - Funding: Whether you're being paid as a consultant vs. volunteering your expertise\n    - Values: Your own views about policing and prisons\n    - Relationships: Whether you are friends with members of the activist organization and/or police\n    - Communications: The degree to which you can control whether and how the organization will publish your preliminary findings\n    - Timeliness:  Whether these findings are relevant to a pending law or policy change\n    \n3. What other factors should be taken into account as you decide whether to share your findings?  Or not taken into account? \n\n4. How has this \"raw data\" been shaped by the journey of the data to get to us? \n\n\n## Lab ##\n\nThe lab related to this material is available at <https://github.com/data-science-methods/lab-w06-eda>. \n\n\n## References\n",
