# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document is a set of notes (and perhaps later a textbook) for a course on data science methods for graduate students in social and behavioral sciences, taught by Professor Dan Hicks (they/them), UC Merced. 

The course site is available [here](..). 

-----

These notes were written in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using *[quarto]*. The complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/data-science-methods/book/). 

This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string`, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) version `r rmarkdown::pandoc_version()`, and the following packages:


```{r pkg-list, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
## From <https://github.com/tidymodels/TMwR/blob/master/index.Rmd>
# deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
# pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
# pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
# df <- tibble::tibble(
#   package = pkgs$package,
#   version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
#   source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
# )
# knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```
