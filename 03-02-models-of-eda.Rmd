> This book is about exploratory data analysis, about looking at data to see what it seems to say. It concentrates on simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw pictures. It regards whatever appearances we have recognized as partial descriptions, and tries to look beneath them for new insights. Its concern is with appearance, not with confirmation. [@TukeyExploratoryDataAnalysis1977]

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is "an attitude, AND a flexibility, AND some graph paper (or transparencies, or both)" [@TukeyWeNeedBoth1980]


## Exploratory and Confirmatory Research ##

- Especially in the wake of the replication crisis, one common distinction is between exploratory and confirmatory research [@WagenmakersAgendaPurelyConfirmatory2012]

Table: Exploratory vs. confirmatory research

------------------------------------
Confirmatory                    Exploratory
---------------------           -------------------------------
hypothesis testing              hypothesis development

specified in advance            adaptable

algorithmic                     free, creative

mechanical objectivity          pure subjectivity? 
[@DastonObjectivity2007]

avoids inferential errors       *makes* errors?

**rigorous**                    **lacking rigor?**

**real science??**              **h\*cking around with data??**

"raw," messy,           "processed," clean,    "laws of nature"? 
unwieldy                stylized

-------------------------------------

## EDA as phenomena development ##

- cleaning messy data 
    - identifying and mitigating (where possible) errors and idiosyncracies
- identifying *local* patterns ("local phenomena")
- **not yet claiming these will be stable and appear elsewhere**
- **not yet worrying (much) about explanations**


## Better Models for EDA II: Epicycle of Analysis ##

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Epicycle of analysis model, @PengArtDataScience2016, 5", out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path('images', '03-eda', 'epicycle.png'), 
                        auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

## @PengArtDataScience2016

- Data analysis is organized into 5 activities
- Each activity involves the same 3-step "epicycle" process
    1. Develop expectations
    2. Collect information
    3. Compare and revise expectations

- Not "the scientific method"! [@PengArtDataScience2016 4]
    - "Highly iterative and non-linear"
    - "information is learned at each step, which then informs
        - **whether (and how) to refine, and redo, the [previous] step** ..., or
        - whether (and how) to proceed to the next step."

## Discussion

- For each of these models, how well do they fit the way you've been taught to do science? 
- How do they challenge the way you've been taught to do science?
